**NFL Team Performance Against the Point Spread When Previous Game Was a Win**

Identified the performance of NFL teams against the point spread when their previous game was a win from 2003 to now.

Scraped the data from teamranking.com using Python, as seen in NFLpointspreadScrape.ipynb.

Saved into a csv file, seen in since2003afterWin.csv.

Used PowerBI for data transformation, seen in DataTransforming.png. 

Created a dashboard, PerformanceAfterWin.pbix, visualizing average performance against the point spread by team by percentage of times covered, and by average margin above or below the point spread.
